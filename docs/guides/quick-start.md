# Quick Start

## 1. Add Rift

Head on over [here](https://getrift.mrvillage.dev) and add Rift to your server. Make sure you have the `Manage Server` permission, `Administrator` permission, or are the server owner!

## 2. Link your nation

- Head to your [nation edit page in-game](https://politicsandwar.com/nation/edit/#discord) and scroll down to the Discord Username section, then put your username in. **Make sure that you include your discriminator. I.e. Village#0001 not just Village**.
- Head on over to Discord and run the `/link` command. To use it, just type `/` into your chat bar, then finish typing `link` and make sure you select the command from Rift.
- Then, in the nation argument put your nation ID, nation link, nation name, or leader name.
- Rift will take a second, then link you! If it fails, then make sure you fix your username in-game and try again!

## 3. Try some commands

- In Discord, try using the command `/me`, you should see your nation information appear!
- Try using `/help` to see a list of commands you can use. Pick a few and try them out.
- If you need additional help, fill in the `command` argument of the `/help` command to get more detailed help on that specific command.
