# Roles

## What are roles?

Roles are Rift's alliance permission system. Similar to Discord roles,
roles have a hierarchy and certain permissions given to its members.
These permissions allow the user to perform certain actions in the
alliance like viewing the alliance bank's balance and reviewing
withdraw requests.

## Why should I use roles?

If you want to do anything banking-related or more specific alliance
management actions then you need to set up a handful of roles.
Thankfully, you can find a guide to assembling a simple role structure
[here](/guides/basic-roles.md).

## How can I make my own roles?

Check out the guide [here](/guides/make-a-role.md) on setting up a
custom alliance role.

the permission bypass **all** permission checks and restrictions and
can create/manage roles with any permissions at any place in the
hierarchy.
