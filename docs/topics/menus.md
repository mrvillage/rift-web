# Menus

## What's a menu?

A menu is a series of buttons (and soon select menus!) that can be customized
and used to perform a variety of different actions in a Discord channel.

## What can I do with a menu?

Menus allow you to add custom buttons that do a variety of actions. Currently,
buttons support the following actions:

- `ADD_ROLE`/`ADD_ROLES`
- `REMOVE_ROLE`/`REMOVE_ROLES`
- `TOGGLE_ROLE`/`TOGGLE_ROLES`
- `CREATE_TICKET`/`CREATE_TICKETS`
- `CREATE_EMBASSY`/`CREATE_EMBASSIES`
